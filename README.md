Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems 
Software Engineering is important in creating software applications and systems that power various aspects in life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of programming language e.g. Fortran, C
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: involves understanding the user needs 
Design: Interpreting and computerizing the requirements 
Implementation: Creating a software to meet the stated requirements 
Testing: Testing the software to ensure quality 
Deployment: releasing the software to the users for them to use it
Maintainance: Future improvement and adjustment of the software created

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards eg requirements to design to Implementation 
While Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: writes codes and implement software solutions 
Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures quality of the software by designing and executing test plan
Project Manager: oversees planing, execution and delivery of software project 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environment (IDEs): provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g. Visual studio, Eclipse 
Version Control System (VCS): used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git, Subversion 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges faced by software engineers includes :
Changing requirements 
Tight deadlines
Technical Debts

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: involves testing a particular subdivision, a particular unit in a software 
Integration Testing: involves testing various subdivisions or units in a particular software 
System Testing: involves testing the whole software 
Acceptance Testing: involves testing the acceptance of the software by the users.
These processes are important so as to create a high quality software that is widely acceptable amongst users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from an AI model
It is important to use prompts so as to get precise answers from an AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: Create a lesson plan on python 
Improved prompt: Create a one week lesson plan on python for kids with ages ranging from ten to sixteen
